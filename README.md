# Basic **Java** and **React.js** setup

To run, type the command below in your terminal in the root of the project's folder:

`./mvnw spring-boot:run` or (`mvnw.bat` for Windows users).

Alternatively you can run the app with npm with the command:
`npm start`.


### Testing

Run the integration (end-to-end) tests with the command:
`npm run integration:test`

This will also start the local server and do requests against it.

To run only server unit tests, use the command: `./mvnw test`.
